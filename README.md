# Models dates manager

Manage models list by dates 
- every date has several models
- every new date contains all the available models by default


# TODO
1. date page - filter models by selected tab
2. date page - check if "uncategorized" tab has to be added
3. date page - for unauthorized users - hide the tabs, and show only the relevant models
4. date page - add token for date + models category
5. date page - add "chosen models" section + relevant action buttons
